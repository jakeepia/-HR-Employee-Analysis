# Employee Analysis

## Introduction
In this HR analysis, I explored the analysis of employee headcount data to gain insights into the size, structure, and changes within the organization's workforce. By analyzing employee headcount data, organizations can assess their workforce composition, identify trends, and make informed decisions regarding talent management, resource allocation, and organizational planning.

## Data Sourcing

I came across the dataset online (it was a csv file). After downloading it, i opened the data in Microsoft Excel for a quick tour before importing it to Power BI for transformation, analysis and visualization.

It had just one table with 21,969 rows and 19 columns.

## Data Transformation
An additional column was created using the Microsoft Excel funtion "vlookup" to group _Age_ in the dataset.

While in Power BI, measures were created for the _Total Employees, Average Employee Rating, Percentage of both Male and Female count._

## Summary
Through my analysis, I gained a clear understanding of the workforce composition. The distribution of employees across departments and job categories to identify areas of concentration was examined. This analysis provided insights into the organization's structure and resource allocation.

Furthermore, I analyzed employee headcount trends over a specific period to identify patterns and changes in the workforce. By comparing headcount data across different timeframes, I assessed workforce growth, identified periods of expansion or downsizing, and examined the impact on the organization's overall workforce.

Additionally, I examined the distribution of employment status, including full-time, and part-time employees to understand the organization's workforce composition and employment arrangements.

Based on my analysis, I derived key findings and recommendations. These included optimizing workforce planning by aligning headcount with departmental needs, identifying areas for talent acquisition or development, and assessing the impact of workforce changes on organizational goals.
